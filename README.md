# Logistic Regression


**Logistic regression** is used for classification
tasks, the goal in classification tasks is to find a function that maps an
observation to its associated class or label. A learning algorithm must use pairs of
feature vectors and their corresponding labels to induce the values of the mapping
function's parameters that produce the best classifier, as measured by a particular
performance metric. In binary classification, the classifier must assign instances to one
of the two classes. Examples of binary classification include predicting whether or not
a patient has a particular disease, whether or not an audio sample contains human
speech. In multiclass classification, the classifier must assign one
of several labels to each instance. In multilabel classification, the classifier must assign
a subset of the labels to each instance.
